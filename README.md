## üìã Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure the following tools are installed:
- **Terraform**: v1.5+
- **AWS CLI**: v2+
- **Git**
---

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Clone the project repository:
   ```bash
   git clone  https://github.com/mohammedd2510/DevOps_CICD_Project_2
   cd DevOps_CICD_Project_2

2. **Set Up AWS Credentials**  
   Configure AWS CLI with your AWS account credentials:  
   ```bash
   aws configure   

3. **Provision Infrastructure with Terraform**  
Navigate to the `terraform` directory, replace the backend S3 bucket name in `Provider_init.tf` with your own, initialize Terraform, and apply the configuration:
    ```bash
    cd ./terraform
    # Replace the backend S3 bucket in Provider_init.tf
    terraform init
    terraform apply

4. **Create Your JFrog Artifactory**:  
   Set up your own JFrog Artifactory by following these steps:  

   - Visit [JFrog Artifactory](https://jfrog.com/artifactory/) and create a free-tier account (or use an existing account).  
   - Create two repositories:  
     - **Maven Repository**: For storing JAR artifacts.  
     - **Docker Repository**: For storing Docker images.  
   - Obtain the **repository URLs** and the **authentication tokens/credentials** for integration in the pipeline.  

5. **Configure GitHub Secrets**:  
   Add the necessary credentials to your GitHub repository secrets for secure access:  

   - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` for AWS access.  
   - `SONARQUBE_TOKEN` for SonarQube authentication.  
   - `JFROG_USERNAME` and `JFROG_PASSWORD` for JFrog Artifactory.  
   - `JFROG_MAVEN_REPO_URL` and `JFROG_DOCKER_REPO_URL` for your Maven and Docker repositories in JFrog.  

6. **Trigger GitHub Actions Workflow**:  
   Push a change to the repository or manually trigger the workflow in GitHub Actions to start the pipeline. The workflow will:  

   - Build the Java application with Maven.  
   - Run unit tests and analyze code quality with SonarQube.  
   - Publish the JAR artifact to your JFrog Maven repository.  
   - Build a Docker image and push it to your JFrog Docker repository.  
   - Deploy the Java application to the EKS cluster.  
   - Configure monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana.
